This means you will learn from experts at the forefront of their fields, undertaking cutting-edge research in a wide range of areas.\nEnvironment\nYou will be part of a large, vibrant department with around 1,750 students across undergraduate, master\u2019s and research programmes and 150 academic staff.\nYou will study in the heart of Edinburgh city centre, regularly voted as one of the most desirable places to live in the world, and one of the UK\u2019s fastest-growing tech hubs.\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramme structure\n\n\n\nYou will follow two taught semesters of lectures, tutorials, project work and written assignments (September to May). During this time you will also learn research methods (such as literature reviews and project planning) to prepare for your final project and dissertation, which is completed during the summer.\nCourses\nAround half your taught course credits must be chosen from areas of artificial intelligence.\nCourse offerings follow the main research areas of our staff, with multiple course options available in natural language processing, machine learning, robotics, and related areas.\nExample courses offered recently in artificial intelligence include:\n\nAccelerated Natural Language Processing\nImage and Vision Computing\nAutomatic Speech Recognition\nMachine Learning & Pattern Recognition\nNatural Language Understanding, Generation, and Machine Translation\nProbabilistic Modelling and Reasoning\nReinforcement Learning\nAdvanced Robotics\nMachine Learning Theory\nCase Studies in AI Ethics\n\nFor your remaining courses, you may choose further options from artificial intelligence or from a wide range of courses offered in other areas of Informatics, including:\n\ncomputer systems\ntheoretical computer science\nsoftware engineering\nsocial and biological computation \n\nWe provide guidance to help you choose a set of courses that work well together, giving you specialised expertise in your chosen area.\nPlease note this degree has flexible course options. Students are only admitted onto the degree if they will have a viable set of options, but not all courses on offer are appropriate for all admitted students. The School of Informatics offers a wide selection of courses, but not all optional courses are guaranteed to run every year, and a few high-demand courses may limit enrolment to students on the most relevant degree(s).\nProject\nThe project is an essential component of the master's degree. It is a substantial piece of full-time independent work supervised by a member of teaching staff.\nYou will have prepared for your research project in semester 2. The project is undertaken over the summer months, culminating in the submission of a dissertation.\nStudents typically choose from a wide range of projects proposed by our academic staff. Students who are sponsored by or have close contact with an industrial company may wish to undertake a project which relates to that company\u2019s activities. Students who self-propose topics (including those in conjunction with industry) must find an interested supervisor from the School of Informatics.\nPart-time study\nThose studying the two-year part-time option take half of the taught credits in their first year, and the other half in the second year, followed by full-time work on the final project in the summer at the end of the second year.\nThere is also a three-year part-time option which spreads the final project over a third year.\nBoth options require flexibility during the semesters: our large course offering means that taught courses have contact times at irregular hours throughout the whole week.\nDelivery\nThis is an in-person programme, and we expect you to be in Edinburgh.\nCourses are taught on campus, both full-time and part-time, during teaching hours (currently 9am-7pm) Monday \u2013 Friday. To succeed, you will need to maintain a consistent level of study each week.\nStudents are expected to stay in Edinburgh for the duration of their degree programme. This includes during the writing of the dissertation until the submission deadline.\nFind out more about compulsory and optional courses\nWe link to the latest information available.
