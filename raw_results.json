You will gain advanced technical skills and a deep understanding of concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence and machine learning to build and support AI empowered systems.DePaul is a perfect place to earn your master\u2019s degree in artificial intelligence:\nA degree focused on a high-growth field. The AI field is growing in leaps and bounds. With an MS in artificial intelligence from DePaul, you can grow with it. Learn how to create complex intelligent systems and integrate AI techniques into existing applications and processes. Explore a wide range of relevant technical areas, including natural language processing, big data systems, computer vision, image processing, robotics and cybersecurity.\nDePaul\u2019s leadership, your advantage.   DePaul is among the first and few to offer an MS in artificial intelligence. Our leadership in the field is not new\u2014we have had active programs in AI-related areas for more than 20 years. Here, you\u2019ll gain the technical knowledge and skills that AI-focused employers are looking for.\nThe DePaul difference.  This is a professional master\u2019s degree, reflecting DePaul\u2019s focus on practical, real-world learning. Small cohorts mean you\u2019ll get personal attention from faculty, many of whom are renowned for their research in the AI and computer science fields. And with courses offered both on campus and online, you can choose the format that best fits your schedule and learning style. This is the DePaul difference, here to provide your path to success in AI.For international students: this is a \r\n      STEM-designated program, which can qualify you to extend your post-graduation stay in the United States.\nDegree Requirements\n\u00a0 CareersAI and Machine Learning Specialists are the #1 fastest-growing roles (World Economic Forum 2023) AI technologies are projected to \r\n                  boost corporate profitability in 16 industries across 12 economies by an average of 38% by 2035 (Accenture Research, 2017).\n92% of reporting School of Computing master\u2019s graduates were employed, continuing education, or not seeking employment within six months of graduation\nView All Faculty\n\n\nBamshad Mobasher\nProfessor Bamshad Mobasher is the director of the Center for Web Intelligence and the co-founder of the Center for Data Science at DePaul. His general research areas include artificial intelligence and machine learning. Dr. Mobasher is considered one of the leading authorities in Web mining, Web personalization, and recommender systems.\nClark Elliott\nAssociate Professor Clark Elliott is one of the founding contributing members of DePaul's neuroscience program and a founding faculty member of the Artificial Intelligence program. Over the course of thirty years at DePaul, Dr. Elliott has developed and taught dozens of distinct courses in computer science, cognitive science and ethics with an emphasis on symbolic artificial intelligence and cognitive modeling.\nNoriko Tomuro\nAssociate Professor Noriko Tomuro has been teaching at DePaul for more than twenty years. Her research interests are in artificial intelligence; in particular, natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning.\nKenny Davila\nAssistant professor Kenny Davila\u2019s research interests include document analysis and recognition, pattern recognition, computer vision and information retrieval. His main research works are related to lecture video analysis, chart mining, and mathematical information retrieval. He has created and released multiple open-source tools for annotating charts and lecture videos, and co-authored award-winning papers at ICFHR 2018, CBDAR 2019, and ICDAR 2019.\n\n\nJamshid Sourati\nAssistant professor Jamshid Sourati\u2019s main research interests revolve around developing and deploying machine learning and AI techniques to model and analyze the flow of knowledge and discoveries in science and technology. Prior to joining DePaul, he was a postdoctoral scholar at the Sociology Department of the University of Chicago, applying learning-based tools to model the flow of collective knowledge in social processes, and worked as a machine learning scientist in the Computational Radiology Lab at Harvard Medical School.\n\nAI Research News \n\u00a0 \nAI, Human Connection Boost Predictions of Hospital Readmission Risk In a new study using predictive AI models, DePaul computer scientist Roselyne Tchoua finds a human element could prevent at-risk patients from falling through the cracks\n\u00a0 \nDePaul and Rosalind Franklin 2024 Interdisciplinary Research GrantsIn a fresh round of funding, DePaul University and Rosalind Franklin University of Science and Medicine are supporting faculty research projects that bring together artificial intelligence and biomedical discovery to address these health care challenges. \n \u00a0 \nDePaul AI Conference Brings Together Industry, Students, and FacultyFor many Fortune 500 companies, innovating on the frontier of artificial intelligence is a top priority. This fall, the Optimizing Digital Innovation Conference brought together talented professionals in technology to share knowledge among industry, students and faculty.\n \u00a0AI & Personalized Recommender Systems\nProfessor Mobasher and his team are engaged in cutting edge research in personalized recommender systems. Recommender systems use machine learning and AI to model user preferences and provide personalized information access, supporting e-commerce, social media, news, music and video streaming and other applications where the volume of content would otherwise be overwhelming. It should not be surprising that some of the most effective providers of on-line information and services including Amazon, LinkedIn, Netflix, Facebook, Spotify, Google, and Apple rely on recommender systems technologies as a core part of their underlying systems.\n \u00a0\nNatural Language Processing\nDr. Peter Hastings and a group of students are developing methods for automatically identifying the causal structure of students\u2019 explanatory scientific essays.\n \u00a0\nEthical \r\n                  AIHow can AI scientists harness the fabulous benefits of AI without wreaking chaos on our world? Discover how to build ethical and trustworthy AI systems in the new Ethics in AI course developed by \r\n               Prof. Clark Elliott.\n\u00a0\nResearch Labs and CentersIn addition to the many teaching and general purpose labs, CDM houses several labs designated to specific research areas that are equipped with advanced technology, software and experimental tools to support faculty and students in their research endeavors.\n \u00a0\nSchool of Computing Research DePaul treats cutting-edge, multidisciplinary, transformative research as integral to its delivery of first-class instruction.
